Crowdsourced wisdom for performing medical procedures

The mantra of _see one, do one, teach one_ in performing routine but
potential dangerous and uncomfortable medical procedures pervade the
culture of the medical profession. Often the least experienced person
gets supervised by the second least experienced person after which they
no longer get observed for the rest of their careers. 

While guides and videos are available on the internet, there is
currently no single service that allows health care professionals to
exchange tips and tricks on improving their technique towards safer and
more effective procedures while maximising patient comfort. SharpScratch
is our solution for this.

This project was built during the [NHS Hack Day][nhshd] Oxford 26-27th January
of 2013 at John Radcliffe Hospital.

## Team

[Idea][idea] proposed by [Wai Keong Wong][keong], Specialist Registrar in Haematology at Royal
Free Hampstead NHS Trust. Preliminary [discussion][discussion].

Coordinated by [Maria Del Mar Yacaman][maria], Patient and Public Engagement at
[Cambridge Healthcare Ltd.][ch]

Back-end development and infrastructure provisioning by [Gerhard
Lazu][gerhard], Lead Engineer at [Cambridge Healthcare Ltd.][ch]

Front-end development by [Szymon Witamborski][szymon], Front-end Developer at
[Cambridge Healthcare Ltd.][ch]

## API

The API is [self-documenting][api] 

## What did we learn?

The app did not have to be taken live, it could have been demo-ed
locally.

Do not do live demos, take time to record a screencast and play that.
The chances of something going wrong are significant, in particular
during the demo (as happened to us).
